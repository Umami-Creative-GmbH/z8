## Permission Management

### Permission Types

The system has four granular team permissions:

1. **Can Create Teams**
   - Allows creating new teams in the organization
   - Typically granted to department heads or senior managers

2. **Can Manage Team Members**
   - Add and remove members from teams
   - Useful for team leads who manage their own teams

3. **Can Manage Team Settings**
   - Edit team name, description, and configuration
   - For team administrators who maintain team information

4. **Can Approve Team Requests**
   - Approve time-off and time corrections for team members
   - Commonly granted to managers and team leads

### Permission Scopes

Permissions can be granted at two levels:

- **Organization-Wide**: Permission applies to all teams
  - Use for: Senior managers, HR administrators
  - Example: Department head can manage all teams in their division

- **Team-Specific**: Permission applies to one specific team only
  - Use for: Team leads, project managers
  - Example: Team lead can only manage their own team

**Important**: Organization-wide permissions override team-specific ones.

### Granting Permissions

To grant permissions to an employee:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Permissions**
2. Find the employee in the list
3. Click **"Edit"** next to their name
4. **Select permission scope**:
   - Choose "All Teams (Organization-wide)" OR
   - Select a specific team from the dropdown
5. **Check permissions** to grant:
   - Can Create Teams
   - Can Manage Team Members
   - Can Manage Team Settings
   - Can Approve Team Requests
6. Click **"Save Permissions"**

**Note**: At least one permission must be selected to save.

### Revoking Permissions

To remove all permissions from an employee:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Permissions**
2. Find the employee
3. Click **"Edit"**
4. Click **"Revoke All"** button
5. Confirm revocation

### Permission Best Practices

- **Grant minimum necessary permissions** - Principle of least privilege
- **Use team-specific permissions when possible** - Better security and clarity
- **Review permissions quarterly** - Ensure they match current roles
- **Document permission policies** - Clear guidelines for granting access
- **Audit permission usage** - Check logs for unusual activity

### Admin vs Regular Permissions

**Admins** automatically have all permissions and cannot be restricted:
- Full access to all features
- Can grant/revoke permissions
- Can override any setting
- System-level privileges

**Non-admin employees** must be explicitly granted permissions:
- Start with no team permissions
- Permissions must be granted by admins
- Can be restricted to specific teams
- Permissions can be revoked at any time

## Best Practices

### Security & Access Control

- **Regular permission audits** - Review who has what access quarterly
- **Principle of least privilege** - Only grant necessary permissions
- **Remove access promptly** - Deactivate employees on their last day
- **Document admin actions** - Keep notes on major changes
- **Use team-specific permissions** - More secure than org-wide for most roles

### Data Management

- **Keep employee records accurate** - Regular data hygiene
- **Maintain manager assignments** - Update when org structure changes
- **Archive old teams properly** - Don't delete historical data unnecessarily
- **Review vacation policies annually** - Ensure they match company policy
- **Back up important configurations** - Document critical settings

### Communication

- **Notify employees of changes** - Transparency builds trust
- **Train new managers** - Ensure they understand their responsibilities
- **Document policies clearly** - Share written guidelines with all employees

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Cannot assign manager - circular relationship detected"
**Problem**: Trying to create a loop (A manages B, B manages A)
**Solution**: Choose a different manager or restructure the management hierarchy

#### "Employee cannot create organization"
**Problem**: Invited user trying to create new organization
**Solution**: This is by design. Only fresh signups can create organizations. Grant admin status if they need this ability.

#### "Permission not taking effect"
**Problem**: User still can't access feature after granting permission
**Solution**:
1. Verify permission was saved (check Permissions page)
2. Ask user to log out and log back in
3. Check if permission scope is correct (org-wide vs team-specific)
4. Verify user is not an admin (admins have all permissions automatically)

#### "Work schedule total hours not calculating correctly"
**Problem**: Total hours don't match expected value
**Solution**:
1. For simple schedule: Verify hours per week value
2. For detailed schedule: Check all 7 days are configured
3. Ensure only work days (checked boxes) are counted
4. Verify no typos in hour values

#### "Vacation balance seems wrong"
**Problem**: Employee's available days don't match expectations
**Solution**:
1. Review vacation allowance page for that employee
2. Check: Annual days + Carryover + Adjustments = Total
3. Verify usage (approved absences) is subtracted correctly
4. Check if custom allowance overrides org default
5. Confirm work schedule (part-time may have prorated vacation)

### Getting Help
