## Vacation Policies

![Vacation Page](/images/admin-guide/vacation-page.png)

Vacation policies define vacation allowances, accrual methods, and carryover rules. Policies use an **effective date model** rather than being year-based, allowing you to schedule policy changes in advance.

### Understanding the Policy Model

Each vacation policy has:

- **Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Standard 2025", "Executive Policy")
- **Effective From**: When the policy becomes active
- **Valid Until**: Optional end date (leave empty for ongoing policies)
- **Company Default**: Whether this is the default for all employees
- **Annual Days**: Base vacation days per year
- **Accrual Type**: How vacation is accrued (annual, monthly, biweekly)
- **Carryover Settings**: Whether unused days can carry over

### Policy Inheritance

Policies are applied in priority order:

1. **Employee Override** (highest priority) - Specific policy assigned to an individual
2. **Team Override** - Policy assigned to a team
3. **Company Default** (lowest priority) - The policy marked as company default

This means an employee with a personal override will use that policy, regardless of their team's policy or the company default.

### Creating a Vacation Policy

1. Go to **Settings** → **Vacation** → **"Policies"** tab
2. Click **"Create Policy"**
3. Configure the policy:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the policy
   - **Effective From**: Start date (defaults to January 1 of next year)
   - **Valid Until**: Optional end date (leave empty for ongoing)
   - **Set as Company Default**: Check to make this the default for all employees
   - **Annual Days**: Base vacation allowance
   - **Accrual Type**: Annual (all at once), Monthly, or Biweekly
   - **Accrual Start Month**: When accrual begins (for monthly/biweekly)
   - **Allow Carryover**: Enable to allow unused days to roll over
   - **Max Carryover Days**: Limit on carried-over days (leave empty for unlimited)
   - **Carryover Expiry**: Months after which carried-over days expire
4. Click **"Create"**

### Setting the Company Default

The company default policy applies to all employees who don't have a team or individual override.

**To set a policy as company default:**
1. Create or edit a policy
2. Check **"Set as Company Default"**
3. Save the policy

**Important**: Setting a new policy as company default will automatically remove the default flag from any existing default policy.

### Scheduling Policy Changes

You can schedule future policy changes by setting effective dates:

**Example - Increasing vacation for next year:**
1. Create a new policy "Standard 2026" with **Effective From** set to January 1, 2026
2. Mark it as **Company Default**
3. The system will show both the current and next scheduled default

The **Assignments** tab shows:
- **Current**: The active company default with its start date
- **Next**: The upcoming default (if scheduled) with when it takes effect

### Policy Statuses

Policies display one of three statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Company Default** | The active default policy for all employees |
| **Active** | A valid policy that can be assigned to teams/employees |
| **Superseded** | Policy whose Valid Until date has passed |

Superseded policies appear dimmed in the list but remain visible for historical reference.

### Team and Employee Overrides

Use the **Assignments** tab to override the company default for specific teams or employees.

**Assigning a Policy to a Team:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Vacation** → **"Assignments"** tab
2. Under **Team Overrides**, click **"Assign to Team"**
3. Select the policy and team
4. Click **"Assign"**

**Assigning a Policy to an Employee:**
1. Under **Employee Overrides**, click **"Assign to Employee"**
2. Select the policy and employee
3. Click **"Assign"**

**Removing an Override:**
- Click the trash icon next to any team or employee override
- The entity will revert to using the company default (or team policy, for employees)

### Employee-Specific Allowances

To customize vacation allowance for an individual employee:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Vacation** → **"Employees"** tab
2. Find the employee
3. Click **"Edit"** next to their name
4. Configure custom allowance:
   - **Custom Annual Days**: Override policy default (leave blank to use policy)
   - **Carryover Days**: Days brought forward from previous year
   - **Adjustment Days**: Add or subtract days (can be positive or negative)
   - **Adjustment Reason**: Required explanation for adjustments
5. **Review total allowance** displayed at top
6. Click **"Save Changes"**

### Allowance Calculations

Total allowance is calculated as:
```
Total = Annual Days + Carryover + Adjustments
```

**Example:**
- Annual Days: 20 (from policy)
- Carryover: 5 (from last year)
- Adjustments: +2 (bonus days)
- **Total Available: 27 days**

### Common Vacation Scenarios

**New Employee Mid-Year:**
1. Create employee profile
2. The policy's accrual settings handle prorating automatically
3. Or: Add a negative adjustment with reason "Pro-rated first year"

**Long-Service Bonus:**
1. Go to employee's vacation settings
2. Add adjustment days (e.g., +5)
3. Enter reason: "10-year service bonus"
4. Save changes

**Different Policy for a Department:**
1. Create a new policy (e.g., "Sales Team - 25 Days")
2. Do NOT mark as company default
3. Assign the policy to the Sales team in the Assignments tab

**Scheduled Policy Increase:**
1. Create new policy with increased days
2. Set **Effective From** to the desired start date
3. Mark as **Company Default**
4. Current employees continue with existing policy until the effective date

### Deleting Policies

- **Active policies** with team/employee assignments cannot be deleted until assignments are removed
- **Company default** policies cannot be deleted - first set another policy as default
- **Superseded policies** can be deleted if no longer needed for records
