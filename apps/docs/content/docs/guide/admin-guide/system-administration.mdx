## Organization Settings

### Multi-Organization Support

Users can belong to multiple organizations and switch between them:

**Switching Organizations:**

1. Click on the organization name in the sidebar
2. Select another organization from the dropdown
3. The page refreshes to show data from the selected organization

**Creating a New Organization:**

1. Click on the organization name in the sidebar
2. Click **"Create Organization"** at the bottom of the dropdown
3. Enter the organization name
4. The organization slug is auto-generated from the name (can be customized)
5. Click **"Create"**

**Organization Roles:**

- **Owner**: Full control, can delete the organization
- **Admin**: Can manage members and settings
- **Member**: Standard access based on permissions

### User Invitations

To invite new users to the organization:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Members** → **"Invite"**

   - **Email**: User's email address
   - **Role**: Initial role (Member, Admin)
   - **Can Create Organizations**: Special permission (usually NO for invited users)
3. Click **"Send Invitation"**

**Important Permission Notes:**
- **Fresh signups** (not invited): CAN create new organizations
- **Invited users**: CANNOT create new organizations by default
- **Admins**: Can always create organizations regardless of invitation status

This prevents invited users from creating competing organizations while allowing organic growth through direct signups.

### Managing Invitations

1. Go to **Settings** → **Members** → **"Invitations"**
2. See list of pending invitations
3. Options:
   - **Resend**: Send invitation email again

### Organization Timezone

Set the default timezone for your organization:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Organization**
2. Find the **Timezone** card
3. Select your organization's timezone from the picker
4. The change saves automatically

**Timezone Resolution Hierarchy:**

The system uses a cascading timezone resolution:

1. **User timezone** (highest priority) - If a user has set a personal timezone in their profile
2. **Organization timezone** - Falls back to the organization's default timezone
3. **UTC** (default) - Used if neither user nor organization timezone is set

**Who can change the timezone:**

- Only **organization owners** can modify the organization timezone
- Admins and members can view the current timezone but cannot change it
- Individual users can override the organization timezone by setting their own in **Settings** → **Profile**

**What timezone affects:**

- Absence tracking and calendar displays
- Time entry displays and calculations
- Report generation and date filtering
- All date-based features throughout the application
