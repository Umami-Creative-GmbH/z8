<Callout type="warn" title="Deprecated">
  **This page describes a deprecated feature.** Work Schedules have been consolidated into the new unified **Work Policies** system.
</Callout>

## Migrated to Work Policies

The Work Schedules functionality has been merged into [Work Policies](/docs/guide/admin-guide/work-policies), which now provides a unified system for managing:

- **Schedules** - Simple and detailed work schedules
- **Regulations** - Labor law compliance and break rules
- **Feature toggles** - Enable/disable schedule or regulation enforcement independently

---

## What Changed

| Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| Separate "Work Schedules" configuration | Unified "Work Policies" with `scheduleEnabled` toggle |
| Individual schedule assignment | Hierarchical assignment (Organization → Team → Employee) |
| Basic schedule types | Enhanced schedule configuration with detailed options |

---

## Migration

All existing work schedules have been automatically migrated to the new Work Policies system. Your schedule configurations remain intact.

**To manage schedules now:**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Work Policies**
2. Create or edit a policy
3. Enable the **Schedule** toggle
4. Configure schedule settings (simple or detailed)
5. Assign to organization, teams, or individual employees
