<Callout type="warn" title="Deprecated">
  **This page describes a deprecated feature.** Time Regulations have been consolidated into the new unified **Work Policies** system.
</Callout>

## Migrated to Work Policies

The Time Regulations functionality has been merged into [Work Policies](/docs/guide/admin-guide/work-policies), which now provides a unified system for managing:

- **Schedules** - Simple and detailed work schedules
- **Regulations** - Labor law compliance and break rules
- **Feature toggles** - Enable/disable schedule or regulation enforcement independently

---

## What Changed

| Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| Separate "Time Regulations" configuration | Unified "Work Policies" with `regulationEnabled` toggle |
| Standalone break rules | Integrated break rules within policies |
| Separate compliance monitoring | Unified compliance dashboard |
| Individual regulation presets | Labor law presets (German, EU, French, etc.) within policies |

---

## Migration

All existing time regulations have been automatically migrated to the new Work Policies system. Your regulation configurations, break rules, and compliance settings remain intact.

**To manage regulations now:**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Work Policies**
2. Create or edit a policy
3. Enable the **Regulation** toggle
4. Configure regulation settings:
   - Maximum daily/weekly hours
   - Break rules by hours worked
   - Rest period requirements
5. Import labor law presets if needed
6. Assign to organization, teams, or individual employees
