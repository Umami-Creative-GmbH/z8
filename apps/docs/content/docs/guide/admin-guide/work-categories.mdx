Work Categories allow you to classify different types of work with associated time factors. This is useful for tracking different work modes like overtime, on-call time, training, or travel time.

## Overview

A Work Category includes:

- **Name** - Descriptive label (e.g., "Overtime", "Travel", "Training")
- **Time Factor** - Multiplier for hours worked (0.5x to 2.0x)
- **Color** - Visual identifier in calendars and reports

## Time Factors

Time factors adjust how hours are counted:

| Factor | Description | Example Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **0.5x** | Half-time credit | Standby/on-call time |
| **1.0x** | Standard time | Normal work hours |
| **1.25x** | Quarter overtime | Evening work |
| **1.5x** | Time and a half | Weekend work |
| **2.0x** | Double time | Holiday work |

<Callout type="info">
  Time factors affect hour calculations in reports and overtime tracking. An employee working 4 hours at 1.5x factor would be credited with 6 hours.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it simple** - Start with a few essential categories
- **Use clear names** - Categories should be self-explanatory
- **Consistent factors** - Use the same factors across teams when possible
- **Train employees** - Ensure everyone knows which category to use when
- **Review usage** - Periodically check if categories are being used correctly
