Change Policies control how employees can modify their time entries and what level of approval is required.

## Overview

A Change Policy defines:

- **Self-service days** - How far back employees can edit entries without approval
- **Approval days** - How far back entries can be edited with manager approval
- **Trust mode** - Whether approval is required at all

---

## Configuration Options

### Self-Service Days

The number of days an employee can edit their own time entries without requiring approval.

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **0 days** | All changes require approval |
| **3 days** | Can edit entries from the last 3 days freely |
| **7 days** | Can edit entries from the last week freely |
| **30 days** | Can edit entries from the last month freely |

<Callout type="info">
  Self-service edits are still logged in the audit trail for compliance.
</Callout>

### Approval Days

The number of days within which time entries can be edited with manager approval.

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **7 days** | Can request approval for entries up to 1 week old |
| **30 days** | Can request approval for entries up to 1 month old |
| **90 days** | Can request approval for entries up to 3 months old |
| **365 days** | Can request approval for entries up to 1 year old |

Entries older than the approval window cannot be modified without admin intervention.

### Trust Mode

<Callout type="warn" title="Trust Mode">
  When `noApprovalRequired` is enabled, all time entry changes are automatically approved. Use only in high-trust environments.
</Callout>

Trust mode settings:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Standard** | Self-service within window, approval required beyond |
| **Trust Mode** | All changes auto-approved, no manager approval needed |

## Assigning Change Policies

Change policies follow the same hierarchical assignment as Work Policies:

```
Organization Default
    ↓
Team Override (optional)
    ↓
Employee Override (optional)
```

### Setting Organization Default

1. Go to **Settings** → **Change Policies**
2. Find the policy
3. Click **"Set as Organization Default"**

### Assigning to Teams or Employees

1. Go to team or employee settings
2. Find the **Change Policy** section
3. Select a policy
4. Save changes

---

## How It Works for Employees

### Within Self-Service Window

1. Employee opens a time entry
2. Makes changes
3. Saves - changes apply immediately
4. Entry logged in audit trail

### Beyond Self-Service Window

1. Employee opens an older time entry
2. Makes changes
3. Clicks **"Request Approval"**
4. Manager receives notification
5. Manager approves or denies
6. Employee notified of decision

### In Trust Mode

1. Employee opens any time entry
2. Makes changes
3. Saves - changes apply immediately
4. No approval required regardless of age

---

## Manager Approval Workflow

When approval is required:

1. **Notification** - Manager receives in-app and email notification
2. **Review** - Manager sees old vs new values
3. **Decision** - Approve or deny with optional comment
4. **Result** - Employee notified, entry updated if approved

### Bulk Approval

Managers can approve multiple pending changes:

1. Go to **Approvals** → **Time Entry Changes**
2. Review pending requests
3. Check multiple items
4. Click **"Approve Selected"** or **"Deny Selected"**

---

## Best Practices

- **Match your payroll cycle** - Set approval days to align with payroll processing
- **Consider your culture** - Trust mode for autonomous teams, strict for regulated industries
- **Communicate clearly** - Ensure employees know the policy
- **Review regularly** - Check if policy meets your needs
- **Use audit logs** - Monitor for unusual patterns even with trust mode
