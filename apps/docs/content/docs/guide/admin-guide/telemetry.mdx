## What We Collect

### Anonymous Usage Metrics

The following aggregated metrics help us understand how Z8 is used:

| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Feature usage counts** | Identify popular features and prioritize development |
| **Error rates** | Detect and fix bugs proactively |
| **Performance metrics** | Monitor and optimize application speed |
| **Browser/OS distribution** | Ensure compatibility with common platforms |

### What We Do NOT Collect

- Employee names or personal information
- Time entry content or notes
- Project names or descriptions
- IP addresses or location data
- Any content you enter into the system

## Deployment ID

Each Z8 installation has a unique **Deployment ID**:

- Generated randomly during installation
- Used to differentiate between deployments in aggregated data
- Contains no information about your organization
- Cannot be traced back to your company or users

<Callout type="info">
The Deployment ID is a random UUID (e.g., `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`) with no embedded information.
</Callout>

## Privacy & GDPR Compliance

### Data Protection Principles

Z8 telemetry follows strict privacy principles:

1. **Data Minimization**: Only essential metrics are collected
2. **Anonymization**: All data is anonymized before transmission
3. **Aggregation**: Data is aggregated across deployments
4. **No PII**: No personally identifiable information is ever collected
5. **Transparency**: This documentation explains exactly what is collected

### GDPR Compliance

Telemetry data collection is compliant with GDPR requirements:

- **Legal Basis**: Legitimate interest in product improvement
- **Data Subject Rights**: Not applicable as no personal data is collected
- **Data Retention**: Aggregated metrics retained for product analytics
- **Data Location**: Processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws

<Callout type="info">
Since telemetry contains no personal data, GDPR data subject rights (access, deletion, portability) do not apply to this anonymized data.
</Callout>

## Opting Out

If your organization prefers not to send telemetry data, you can disable it:

1. Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Telemetry**
2. Toggle **"Send anonymous usage data"** to off
3. Click **Save**

<Callout type="warn">
Disabling telemetry means we cannot proactively detect issues affecting your deployment. Consider leaving it enabled to help us improve the product.
</Callout>

## Data Security

All telemetry data is:

- Transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections
- Stored in secure, access-controlled systems
- Never sold or shared with third parties
- Used exclusively for product improvement
