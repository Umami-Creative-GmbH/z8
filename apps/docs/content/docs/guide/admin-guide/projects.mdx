## Overview

Projects allow you to organize work, track time against specific initiatives, and monitor budgets and deadlines. Employees can assign their time entries to projects, giving you visibility into resource allocation and project health.

## Project Status Lifecycle

Projects progress through five status states:

| Status | Description | Time Tracking |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Planned** | Not yet started | Disabled |
| **Active** | Currently in progress | Enabled |
| **Paused** | Temporarily halted | Disabled |
| **Completed** | Work finished | Disabled |
| **Archived** | Historical record | Disabled |

<Callout type="info">
Only **Active** projects appear in the time tracking project selector. Change status to "Active" when ready for employees to log time.
</Callout>

---

## Budget Tracking

### Setting a Budget

When creating or editing a project, enter the total hours allocated in the **Budget Hours** field. This enables budget tracking features.

### Budget Progress Indicators

The system displays budget consumption with color-coded progress bars:

- **Green** (0-70%): On track
- **Yellow** (70-90%): Approaching limit
- **Red** (90-100%): Near or at budget
- **Dark Red** (>100%): Over budget

### Budget Alerts

When a project reaches critical budget thresholds, the system can send notifications to project managers.

---

## Deadline Management

### Setting Deadlines

Add a deadline date to track project timelines. The system calculates and displays:

- **Days remaining** until deadline
- **"Due tomorrow"** or **"Due today"** warnings
- **Days overdue** for past deadlines

### Deadline Status Badges

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Red | Overdue or due today |
| Amber | Due within 7 days |
| Plain text | More than 7 days remaining |

<Callout type="warn">
Projects with passed deadlines are highlighted in red throughout the system.
</Callout>
