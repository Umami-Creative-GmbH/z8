### Status Filter

## Using Reports Effectively

### Weekly Check-ins

Review the portfolio weekly to:
1. Identify projects approaching budget limits
2. Check for overdue deadlines
3. Verify active projects have recent time entries

### Project Health Indicators

**Healthy Project**:
- Budget under 70% with proportional timeline progress
- Recent time entries
- Multiple team members contributing

**At-Risk Project**:
- Budget over 90% before deadline
- No time entries in recent days
- Single contributor (bus factor risk)

**Problem Project**:
- Over budget
- Past deadline
- No recent activity despite "Active" status

### End-of-Project Review

When completing a project:
1. Generate a final report for the full project duration
2. Compare actual hours to budgeted hours
3. Review team breakdown to understand resource allocation
4. Document findings in the project description for future reference
