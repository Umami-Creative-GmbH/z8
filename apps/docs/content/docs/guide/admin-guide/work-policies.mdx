Work Policies provide a unified system that combines work schedules and time regulations into a single, configurable policy. This replaces the previous separate "Work Schedules" and "Time Regulations" features.

## Overview

A Work Policy can include:

- **Schedule** - Define expected work hours (simple or detailed)
- **Regulation** - Enforce labor law compliance (max hours, breaks)

Each component can be independently enabled or disabled using feature toggles.

---

## Feature Toggles

| Toggle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scheduleEnabled` | Enable work schedule tracking and expectations |
| `regulationEnabled` | Enable labor law compliance enforcement |

<Callout type="info">
  You can enable schedules without regulations, regulations without schedules, or both together depending on your organization's needs.
</Callout>

## Compliance Monitoring

When regulations are enabled, the system monitors compliance:

### Viewing Violations

1. Go to **Settings** → **Work Policies** → **"Compliance"**
2. See violations grouped by type:
   - **Overtime** - Daily or weekly hours exceeded
   - **Missing Breaks** - Required breaks not taken
   - **Rest Violations** - Insufficient rest between shifts
3. Filter by date range, team, or employee
4. Export compliance reports for auditing

### Violation Notifications

Configure automatic notifications for compliance violations:

- Email alerts to managers
- In-app notifications
- Weekly compliance summary reports

## Best Practices

- **Start with presets** - Use labor law presets as a starting point
- **Use hierarchy wisely** - Set a sensible organization default, override only when needed
- **Enable what you need** - Only enable schedule or regulation if you'll use it
- **Review compliance regularly** - Check compliance dashboard weekly
- **Document exceptions** - Note why specific employees have different policies
