## Best Practices

<Tabs items={['Security', 'Data', 'Communication', 'Process']}>
  <Tab value="Security">
    ### Security & Access Control
    - **Regular permission audits** - Review who has what access quarterly
    - **Principle of least privilege** - Only grant necessary permissions
    - **Remove access promptly** - Deactivate employees on their last day
    - **Document admin actions** - Keep notes on major changes
    - **Use team-specific permissions** - More secure than org-wide for most roles
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Data">
    ### Data Management
    - **Keep employee records accurate** - Regular data hygiene
    - **Maintain manager assignments** - Update when org structure changes
    - **Archive old teams properly** - Don't delete historical data unnecessarily
    - **Review vacation policies annually** - Ensure they match company policy
    - **Back up important configurations** - Document critical settings
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Communication">
    ### Communication
    - **Notify employees of changes** - Transparency builds trust
    - **Train new managers** - Ensure they understand their responsibilities
    - **Document policies clearly** - Share written guidelines with all employees
    - **Respond to questions promptly** - Be accessible to users
    - **Announce new features** - Keep users informed of system updates
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Process">
    ### Process Management
    - **Standardize onboarding** - Consistent process for new employees
    - **Plan team restructures** - Coordinate manager and team changes
    - **Schedule regular reviews** - Quarterly check-in on system usage
    - **Monitor approval times** - Ensure managers are responsive
    - **Track system usage** - Identify unused features or problem areas
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Cannot assign manager - circular relationship detected">
    **Problem**: Trying to create a loop (A manages B, B manages A)

    **Solution**: Choose a different manager or restructure the management hierarchy
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Employee cannot create organization">
    **Problem**: Invited user trying to create new organization

    **Solution**: This is by design. Only fresh signups can create organizations. Grant admin status if they need this ability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission not taking effect">
    **Problem**: User still can't access feature after granting permission

    **Solution**:
    1. Verify permission was saved (check Permissions page)
    2. Ask user to log out and log back in
    3. Check if permission scope is correct (org-wide vs team-specific)
    4. Verify user is not an admin (admins have all permissions automatically)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Work schedule total hours not calculating correctly">
    **Problem**: Total hours don't match expected value

    **Solution**:
    1. For simple schedule: Verify hours per week value
    2. For detailed schedule: Check all 7 days are configured
    3. Ensure only work days (checked boxes) are counted
    4. Verify no typos in hour values
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vacation balance seems wrong">
    **Problem**: Employee's available days don't match expectations

    **Solution**:
    1. Review vacation allowance page for that employee
    2. Check: Annual days + Carryover + Adjustments = Total
    3. Verify usage (approved absences) is subtracted correctly
    4. Check if custom allowance overrides org default
    5. Confirm work schedule (part-time may have prorated vacation)
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
