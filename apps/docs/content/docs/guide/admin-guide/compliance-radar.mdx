## Overview

Compliance Radar is z8's automated labor-law compliance monitoring system. It continuously scans time entries to detect potential violations of German Working Time Act (Arbeitszeitgesetz, ArbZG) regulations, helping organizations maintain legal compliance and protect employee wellbeing.

The system runs as a nightly batch job that analyzes completed work periods across your organization. When violations are detected, findings are created with detailed evidence and assigned severity levels. Managers and administrators can then review, acknowledge, waive, or resolve these findings through a centralized dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
Compliance Radar is available for organizations operating under German labor law. The default thresholds align with ArbZG requirements but can be customized to match your organization's specific policies.

## Dashboard

The Compliance Radar dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your organization's compliance status. Access it via **Settings > Compliance Radar**.

### Stats Overview

The dashboard displays four key metrics at the top:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Open Findings** | Total number of unresolved compliance findings, with trend indicator (improving, stable, or needs attention) |
| **Critical** | Findings requiring immediate action (25%+ over threshold) |
| **Warnings** | Findings that should be reviewed (10-25% over threshold) |
| **Info** | Findings for awareness (under 10% over threshold) |

Critical findings are highlighted with a red background, while warnings display an orange background to draw attention.

### Dashboard Widget

A Compliance Radar widget is available on the main dashboard for managers and administrators. It shows:
- Total open findings count
- Severity breakdown (Critical, Warning, Info)
- Status indicator with appropriate urgency messaging
- Quick link to the full Compliance Radar settings page

The widget only appears when there are open findings to review.

## Violation Detection

Compliance Radar detects four types of ArbZG violations:

### Insufficient Rest Period

Monitors the rest time between consecutive work shifts. Under ArbZG, employees must have at least **11 hours** of uninterrupted rest between working days.

**Evidence captured:**
- Last clock-out time
- Next clock-in time
- Actual rest duration
- Required rest duration
- Shortfall amount

### Daily Hours Exceeded

Tracks when an employee works more than the maximum allowed hours in a single day. The ArbZG standard limit is **10 hours** per day.

**Evidence captured:**
- Date of violation
- Total hours worked
- Daily limit
- Amount exceeded
- Related work period IDs

### Weekly Hours Exceeded

Monitors cumulative weekly working hours. The ArbZG standard limit is **48 hours** per week (averaged over a reference period).

**Evidence captured:**
- Week start and end dates
- Total hours worked
- Weekly limit
- Amount exceeded
- Related work period IDs

### Consecutive Days Exceeded

Detects when employees work too many days in a row without a rest day. The default threshold is **6 consecutive days**.

**Evidence captured:**
- Start and end dates of the consecutive period
- Number of consecutive days worked
- Maximum allowed days
- List of work dates

### Severity Calculation

Severity is automatically calculated based on how far the violation exceeds the threshold:

| Severity | Criteria | Recommended Action |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | 25% or more over threshold | Immediate review required |
| **Warning** | 10-25% over threshold | Should be reviewed promptly |
| **Info** | Under 10% over threshold | For awareness and tracking |

## Managing Findings

### Findings Table

The Findings tab displays all compliance findings in a filterable table with columns for:
- **Employee** - Name of the affected employee
- **Type** - Category of violation
- **Severity** - Critical, Warning, or Info
- **Date** - When the violation occurred
- **Status** - Current finding status

Click any row to open the finding detail dialog.

### Filtering Findings

Use the filter dropdowns to narrow results:

**By Status:**
- Open (default) - New findings requiring attention
- Acknowledged - Reviewed but not yet resolved
- Waived - Exempted from compliance tracking
- Resolved - Completed findings

**By Severity:**
- Critical
- Warning
- Info

Managers can only view findings for their direct reports, while administrators see all organizational findings.

### Finding Actions

When viewing a finding detail, several actions are available:

#### Acknowledge

Available to managers and administrators when a finding is in "Open" status.

Acknowledging a finding indicates that management is aware of the violation. You can optionally add a note explaining the circumstances. The employee is notified when their finding is acknowledged.

#### Waive

**Admin only.** Available when a finding is "Open" or "Acknowledged".

Waiving a finding exempts it from compliance tracking. A reason is **required** explaining why the waiver is justified (e.g., emergency situation, pre-approved overtime). The employee is notified when their finding is waived, including the waiver reason.

<Callout type="warning">
Use waivers sparingly. All waivers are logged in the audit trail and should have documented business justification.
</Callout>

#### Resolve

Available to managers and administrators when a finding is "Open" or "Acknowledged".

Resolving marks the finding as addressed. Add an optional resolution note describing any corrective actions taken.

## Exception Requests

Employees can request pre-approval for compliance exceptions before they occur. This is useful for planned overtime or situations where rest periods may be shortened.

### Exception Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Rest Period Exception** | Request to clock in before completing the 11-hour rest period |
| **Daily Overtime** | Request to work beyond the daily hour threshold |
| **Weekly Overtime** | Request to work beyond the weekly hour threshold |
| **Monthly Overtime** | Request to work beyond the monthly hour threshold |

### Request Workflow

1. **Employee submits request** - Provides exception type, reason, and optional planned duration
2. **Manager notified** - Receives notification of pending exception request
3. **Manager approves/rejects** - Reviews request and makes decision
4. **Employee notified** - Receives approval or rejection with any notes
5. **Exception valid for 24 hours** - Approved exceptions expire after 24 hours

### Linking to Findings

When a violation occurs that matches an approved exception, the finding is automatically linked to the exception. This provides context showing the violation was pre-approved rather than unexpected.

## Configuration

Administrators can customize Compliance Radar behavior in the **Configuration** tab.

### Detection Rules

Enable or disable specific violation types:

| Rule | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Rest Period Violations | Enabled | Detect insufficient rest between shifts |
| Daily Hours Exceeded | Enabled | Detect daily overtime violations |
| Weekly Hours Exceeded | Enabled | Detect weekly overtime violations |
| Consecutive Days Exceeded | Enabled | Detect excessive consecutive work days |

### Threshold Overrides

Customize detection thresholds. Leave empty to use work policy defaults.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Minimum Rest Period | 660 minutes (11 hours) | Required rest between shifts |
| Max Daily Minutes | 600 minutes (10 hours) | Maximum daily working time |
| Max Weekly Minutes | 2880 minutes (48 hours) | Maximum weekly working time |
| Max Consecutive Days | 6 days | Maximum days without rest |

<Callout type="info">
Threshold overrides in Compliance Radar apply organization-wide. For employee-specific limits, configure them in Work Policies.
</Callout>

### Notification Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Notify Managers | Enabled | Send notifications when findings are detected |
| Minimum Severity | Warning | Only notify for findings at or above this level |
| Teams Daily Digest | Disabled | Send daily summary to Microsoft Teams channel |
| Employee Visibility | Disabled | Allow employees to view their own findings |

### Auto-Resolution

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Auto-resolve after days | 90 | Automatically resolve findings after N days (0 to disable) |

Auto-resolution helps maintain a clean findings list by closing old issues that were never formally addressed.

## Best Practices

### Regular Review Cadence

- Review critical findings **daily**
- Review warning findings **weekly**
- Review info findings **monthly** as part of compliance reporting

### Documentation Standards

- Always add notes when acknowledging or resolving findings
- Document business justification for all waivers
- Use consistent terminology across your team

### Proactive Management

- Encourage employees to submit exception requests **before** overtime
- Monitor trends to identify systemic issues (e.g., understaffing)
- Use the analytics to inform scheduling decisions

### Audit Trail

All Compliance Radar actions are logged in the audit trail:
- Finding creation by detection job
- Acknowledgments with notes
- Waivers with reasons
- Resolutions with notes
- Configuration changes

Maintain this audit trail for labor inspections and internal compliance reviews.

### Communication

- Discuss findings with affected employees promptly
- Explain the importance of compliance for their wellbeing
- Work together to prevent recurring violations
