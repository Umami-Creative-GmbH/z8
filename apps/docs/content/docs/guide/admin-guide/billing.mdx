## Overview

z8 uses a seat-based subscription model powered by Stripe. Each active employee in your organization counts as one seat. Organization administrators can manage their subscription, view billing details, and access invoices from the billing settings page.

<Callout type="info">
Billing is only available when enabled for your z8 instance. Self-hosted deployments can operate without billing by leaving the `BILLING_ENABLED` flag disabled.
</Callout>

## Pricing Plans

z8 offers two billing cycles with per-seat pricing:

| Plan | Price per Seat | Billing Cycle | Savings |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| **Monthly** | €4 / month | Billed monthly | - |
| **Yearly** | €3 / month | Billed annually | 25% discount |

## FAQ

### What happens if my payment fails?

Stripe will automatically retry the payment over several days. During this time, your access remains unchanged. If all retries fail, your organization enters read-only mode until payment is resolved.

### Can I get a refund?

Contact your z8 administrator or support for refund requests. Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis through Stripe.

### Do I need billing for self-hosted?

No. Self-hosted z8 deployments can disable billing entirely. All features are available without a subscription when `BILLING_ENABLED` is not set.

### How are seats counted for part-time employees?

All active employees count as one seat regardless of hours worked or employment type. Only deactivated employees are excluded from the count.
