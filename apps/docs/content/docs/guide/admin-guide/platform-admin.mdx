## Overview

The Platform Admin Dashboard provides super-administrators with centralized control over the entire z8 platform. This multi-tenant management interface allows platform administrators to oversee all organizations, manage users across the platform, and maintain overall system health.

Platform administration is distinct from organization-level administration. While organization admins manage settings within their own workspace, platform admins have visibility and control across all organizations on the platform.

<Callout type="warn">
Platform admin access should be restricted to a very limited number of trusted individuals. All actions performed in the platform admin dashboard are logged for audit purposes.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

To access the Platform Admin Dashboard, you must:

- Have an active user account with the `admin` role
- Not be banned from the platform
- Be signed in with valid credentials

The platform admin role is assigned at the database level and cannot be self-granted. Contact your system administrator or database team to assign platform admin privileges.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to `/admin` to access the Platform Admin Dashboard. The admin layout includes:

- **Dashboard**: Overview statistics and quick access links
- **Users**: Cross-platform user management
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant organization management

An "Exit Admin" link is always available in the header to return to the regular application.

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard displays four key statistics at a glance:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Users** | All registered users across the platform |
| **Banned Users** | Users currently banned from accessing the platform |
| **Organizations** | Total active organizations (excluding deleted) |
| **Suspended Orgs** | Organizations currently in read-only mode |

Each statistic card is clickable and navigates to the relevant management page with appropriate filters applied.

<Callout type="info">
Cards for banned users and suspended organizations display a warning or destructive border color when counts are greater than zero, providing visual alerts for issues requiring attention.
</Callout>

## User Management

The User Management page (`/admin/users`) provides tools to view and manage all users across the platform.

### Viewing Users

The user list displays:

- **User**: Name, email, and profile image
- **Role**: Admin or standard user badge
- **Status**: Active or Banned (with expiry date if temporary)
- **Created**: Account creation date

### Filtering Users

Use the search and filter controls to find specific users:

- **Search**: Filter by name or email (debounced 300ms)
- **Status Filter**: All, Active, or Banned

### Banning Users

To ban a user from the platform:

1. Click the ban icon in the user's row
2. Enter a reason for the ban (required)
3. Optionally set an expiry date for temporary bans
4. Click "Ban User"

<Callout type="warn">
Platform admin users cannot be banned. You must first revoke their admin role before banning.
</Callout>

When a user is banned:

- They are immediately logged out of all sessions
- They cannot sign in until the ban is lifted or expires
- The ban reason is recorded for audit purposes

### Unbanning Users

To restore a banned user's access:

1. Filter to show banned users
2. Click the checkmark icon in the user's row
3. The ban is immediately lifted

### Session Management

Platform admins can view and revoke user sessions:

1. Click the devices icon in a user's row
2. View all active sessions with device info and IP addresses
3. Revoke individual sessions or all sessions at once

Revoking sessions forces the user to sign in again on those devices.

## Organization Management

The Organization Management page (`/admin/organizations`) provides oversight and control over all organizations on the platform.

### Viewing Organizations

The organization list displays:

- **Organization**: Name, slug, and logo
- **Employees**: Count of active employees in the organization
- **Members**: Count of platform users who are members
- **Status**: Active, Suspended, or Deleted
- **Created**: Organization creation date

### Filtering Organizations

Use the search and filter controls to find specific organizations:

- **Search**: Filter by organization name or slug (debounced 300ms)
- **Status Filter**: All, Active, Suspended, or Deleted

### Suspending Organizations

Suspension puts an organization in read-only mode. Members can view data but cannot create or edit records.

To suspend an organization:

1. Click the pause icon in the organization's row
2. Enter a reason for the suspension (required)
3. Click "Suspend Organization"

Common reasons for suspension include:

- Payment issues or subscription lapses
- Policy violations
- Pending investigation
- Customer request

<Callout type="info">
Suspended organizations display a warning badge with the suspension reason visible on hover.
</Callout>

### Unsuspending Organizations

To restore full access to a suspended organization:

1. Filter to show suspended organizations
2. Click the play icon in the organization's row
3. The suspension is immediately lifted

### Deleting Organizations

To delete an organization and all its data:

1. Click the trash icon in the organization's row
2. Configure deletion options:
   - **Delete immediately**: Skip the 5-day grace period
   - **Skip notification**: Do not notify organization members
3. Type the organization name to confirm
4. Click "Delete Organization"

<Callout type="error">
Organization deletion is irreversible. All associated data including employees, time entries, projects, and documents will be permanently removed.
</Callout>

By default, deleted organizations enter a 5-day grace period before permanent deletion. This allows for recovery if the deletion was accidental.

## Audit Logging

All platform admin actions are recorded in the `platform_admin_audit_log` table. Logged actions include:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ban_user` | User was banned from the platform |
| `unban_user` | User ban was lifted |
| `revoke_session` | Individual session was revoked |
| `revoke_all_sessions` | All user sessions were revoked |
| `suspend_org` | Organization was suspended |
| `unsuspend_org` | Organization suspension was lifted |
| `delete_org` | Organization was scheduled for deletion |

Each audit log entry includes:

- Admin user ID
- Action type
- Target type and ID
- Action metadata (reason, expiry, etc.)
- IP address
- Timestamp

## Database Schema

The platform admin feature introduces two new tables:

### Platform Admin Audit Log

Tracks all administrative actions:

```sql
platform_admin_audit_log (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  admin_user_id text REFERENCES user(id),
  action text NOT NULL,
  target_type text NOT NULL,
  target_id text NOT NULL,
  metadata text,
  ip_address text,
  user_agent text,
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
)
```

### Organization Suspension

Tracks organization suspension history:

```sql
organization_suspension (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id text REFERENCES organization(id),
  reason text NOT NULL,
  suspended_by text REFERENCES user(id),
  suspended_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  unsuspended_at timestamp,
  unsuspended_by text REFERENCES user(id),
  is_active boolean DEFAULT true
)
```

## Best Practices

### Security

- Limit platform admin access to essential personnel only
- Regularly audit who has platform admin privileges
- Review the audit log periodically for unusual activity
- Use strong authentication methods for admin accounts

### User Management

- Always document the reason when banning users
- Prefer temporary bans with expiry dates when appropriate
- Revoke sessions immediately when investigating suspicious activity
- Consider suspending the organization rather than banning all its users

### Organization Management

- Attempt to resolve issues before suspending organizations
- Communicate with organization owners before taking action
- Use the 5-day grace period unless immediate deletion is critical
- Notify organization members of pending deletion (default behavior)

### Incident Response

1. If suspicious activity is detected, immediately revoke affected sessions
2. Ban compromised accounts while investigating
3. Suspend affected organizations if data integrity is at risk
4. Document all actions taken in an external incident log
5. Review audit logs to understand the scope of the incident

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Access Admin Dashboard

- Verify your account has the `admin` role in the database
- Check that your account is not banned
- Ensure you are signed in with the correct account

### Actions Not Reflecting Immediately

- The page revalidates after each action; try refreshing
- Check for error toast messages indicating failed operations
- Verify your network connection

### Audit Logs Not Appearing

- Audit logs are written asynchronously; allow a few seconds
- Check the database connection and table permissions
- Verify the `platform_admin_audit_log` table exists
