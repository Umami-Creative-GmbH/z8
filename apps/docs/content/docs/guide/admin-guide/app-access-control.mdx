App Access Control allows administrators to restrict which Z8 applications users can access. This is useful for compliance, security policies, or limiting access based on user roles.

---

## Understanding App Access

Z8 offers multiple applications:

| Application | Description | Default Access |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Web App** | Full-featured browser application | Enabled |
| **Desktop App** | Lightweight time tracking widget | Enabled |
| **Mobile App** | Native mobile companion | Enabled |

By default, all users can access all applications. Administrators can restrict access per user.

---

## Use Cases

### Security Compliance

- **Contractors**: Restrict to web-only to maintain oversight
- **Sensitive roles**: Disable mobile to prevent off-premises access
- **BYOD restrictions**: Limit desktop app to company devices

### Role-Based Access

- **Field workers**: Mobile-only for on-site time tracking
- **Office staff**: Web and desktop, no mobile needed
- **Remote workers**: Full access to all applications

### Temporary Restrictions

- **Onboarding**: Start with web-only, expand later
- **Investigation**: Temporarily restrict access during reviews
- **Transitions**: Limit access during role changes

## Managing User Access

### From Employee Management

1. Go to **Employees** in the sidebar
2. Click on the employee's profile
3. Scroll to **App Access** section
4. Toggle access for each application:
   - Web Application
   - Desktop Application
   - Mobile Application
5. Changes save automatically

### From Organization Settings

1. Go to **Settings** > **Members**
2. Find the user in the members list
3. Click **Edit Access**
4. Configure app permissions
5. Click **Save**

---

## Access Behavior

### When Access is Granted

- User can log in to the application
- All features available based on their role
- Normal session management applies

### When Access is Denied

1. User attempts to access the application
2. System detects the app type from the request
3. Access check fails
4. User sees the "Access Denied" page
5. Audit log entry created

<Callout type="info" title="Clear Messaging">
  Denied users see a clear message explaining which application they cannot access and are advised to contact their administrator.
</Callout>

---

## How Apps Are Detected

The system automatically detects which application is making the request:

| Detection Method | App Type |
|------------------|----------|
| Cookie authentication | Web App |
| Bearer token + mobile user agent | Mobile App |
| Bearer token + other user agent | Desktop App |

This detection is automatic and requires no user configuration.

---

## Audit Logging

All access control events are logged:

### Access Changes

When permissions are modified:
- Who made the change
- Which user was affected
- Which app access changed
- Previous and new values
- Timestamp

### Access Denials

When access is denied:
- User who was denied
- Which app they tried to access
- IP address
- User agent
- Timestamp

Access audit logs in **Settings** > **Audit Logs** and filter by "App Access".

---

## Bulk Management

### Using Filters

1. Go to **Employees**
2. Filter by team, location, or role
3. Select multiple employees
4. Click **Bulk Actions** > **Update App Access**
5. Set permissions
6. Click **Apply**

### Import/Export

App access settings can be included in employee data exports and imports:

```csv
email,canUseWebapp,canUseDesktop,canUseMobile
john@example.com,true,true,false
jane@example.com,true,false,false
```

---

## Default Settings

### New Employees

New employees receive full access to all applications by default.

### Invited Users

Users invited to the organization also receive full access by default. Adjust permissions after they join if needed.

### Deactivated Employees

Deactivating an employee revokes all access. App access settings are preserved if the employee is later reactivated.

---

## Integration with Other Features

### Session Management

- Changing app access doesn't terminate existing sessions
- User will be denied on their next API request
- Consider manually revoking sessions for immediate effect

### Two-Factor Authentication

- 2FA requirements apply regardless of app access
- Users must complete 2FA on allowed applications
- Denied apps don't bypass 2FA

### Organization Switching

- App access is checked per organization
- Users may have different access in different organizations
- Switching organizations re-validates access

---

## Best Practices

### Principle of Least Privilege

Only grant access to applications users actually need.

### Document Policies

Create clear policies about who gets access to which apps:
- By role
- By department
- By employment type

### Regular Reviews

Periodically audit app access:
1. Export user permissions
2. Review against current policies
3. Adjust as needed
4. Document changes

### Communicate Changes

When restricting access:
1. Notify affected users in advance
2. Explain the reason
3. Provide alternative access methods if available
4. Update documentation

---

## Troubleshooting

### User reports "Access Denied" unexpectedly

1. Check their app access settings in employee profile
2. Verify they're accessing the correct organization
3. Check audit logs for recent permission changes
4. Ensure their account is active

### Access changes not taking effect

1. User may have cached session
2. Ask them to log out and back in
3. Check if they're using the correct app
4. Verify the change was saved

### Can't modify user's access

1. Verify you have admin permissions
2. Check if the user is the organization owner
3. Organization owners cannot have their webapp access restricted
4. Contact support if issues persist
