## Permission Types

The system has four granular team permissions:

1. **Can Create Teams**
   - Allows creating new teams in the organization
   - Typically granted to department heads or senior managers

2. **Can Manage Team Members**
   - Add and remove members from teams
   - Useful for team leads who manage their own teams

3. **Can Manage Team Settings**
   - Edit team name, description, and configuration
   - For team administrators who maintain team information

4. **Can Approve Team Requests**
   - Approve time-off and time corrections for team members
   - Commonly granted to managers and team leads

## Permission Scopes

Permissions can be granted at two levels:

- **Organization-Wide**: Permission applies to all teams
  - Use for: Senior managers, HR administrators
  - Example: Department head can manage all teams in their division

- **Team-Specific**: Permission applies to one specific team only
  - Use for: Team leads, project managers
  - Example: Team lead can only manage their own team

**Important**: Organization-wide permissions override team-specific ones.

## Permission Best Practices

- **Grant minimum necessary permissions** - Principle of least privilege
- **Use team-specific permissions when possible** - Better security and clarity
- **Review permissions quarterly** - Ensure they match current roles
- **Document permission policies** - Clear guidelines for granting access
- **Audit permission usage** - Check logs for unusual activity

## Admin vs Regular Permissions

**Admins** automatically have all permissions and cannot be restricted:
- Full access to all features
- Can grant/revoke permissions
- Can override any setting
- System-level privileges

**Non-admin employees** must be explicitly granted permissions:
- Start with no team permissions
- Permissions must be granted by admins
- Can be restricted to specific teams
- Permissions can be revoked at any time
