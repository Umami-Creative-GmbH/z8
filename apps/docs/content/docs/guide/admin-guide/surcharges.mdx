## Overview

The surcharge system allows you to define premium pay rules that grant additional time credits for work performed during specific periods—such as nights, weekends, or holidays. Surcharges automatically calculate bonus time based on when employees work.

<Callout type="info">
Surcharges add **time credits**, not direct monetary bonuses. A 50% surcharge on 2 hours of work adds 1 hour of credited time.
</Callout>

## Key Concepts

### Surcharge Models

A **surcharge model** is a collection of rules that define when premium time applies. Examples:
- "Weekend Premium" - Rules for Saturday and Sunday
- "Night Shift" - Rules for work between 22:00-06:00
- "Holiday Pay" - Rules for specific holiday dates

### Surcharge Rules

Rules define the conditions and percentages for surcharges. Three rule types are available:

<Tabs items={['Day-of-Week', 'Time Window', 'Date-Based']}>
  <Tab value="Day-of-Week">
    ### Day-of-Week Rules
    Apply surcharges on specific days of the week.

    **Example**: 50% surcharge on Sundays
    - Rule type: Day-of-Week
    - Day: Sunday
    - Percentage: 50%
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Time Window">
    ### Time Window Rules
    Apply surcharges during specific hours.

    **Example**: 25% surcharge for night work
    - Rule type: Time Window
    - Start time: 22:00
    - End time: 06:00
    - Percentage: 25%

    <Callout type="info">
    Time windows can span midnight. A 22:00-06:00 window covers late evening AND early morning.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Date-Based">
    ### Date-Based Rules
    Apply surcharges on specific dates or date ranges.

    **Example**: 100% surcharge on Christmas
    - Rule type: Date-Based
    - Date: December 25
    - Percentage: 100%

    **Example**: 75% surcharge during summer shutdown
    - Rule type: Date-Based
    - Date range: August 1-15
    - Percentage: 75%
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Assignment Hierarchy

Surcharge models are assigned at three levels, with the most specific taking precedence:

1. **Employee Level** (highest priority) - Individual override
2. **Team Level** - Applies to all team members
3. **Organization Level** (lowest priority) - Default for everyone

<Callout type="info">
If an employee has both a team and organization assignment, the **team assignment** takes precedence. Employee-level assignments override both.
</Callout>

## How Surcharges Are Calculated

The system evaluates each minute of a work period to determine applicable surcharges:

1. **Rule Evaluation**: Each minute is checked against all active rules
2. **Max Wins Policy**: When multiple rules apply, the highest percentage wins
3. **Aggregation**: Minutes are summed per rule for the final calculation

### Calculation Example

An employee works 8:00 PM to 2:00 AM (6 hours) with these rules:
- Night Premium (22:00-06:00): 25%
- Sunday Premium (all day): 50%

If the shift is on Sunday night:
- 8:00 PM - 10:00 PM: Sunday rule applies (50%)
- 10:00 PM - 2:00 AM: Both rules apply, Sunday wins (50%)

**Result**: 6 hours × 50% = 3 hours surcharge credit

<Callout type="info">
The "max wins" policy means you never get double surcharges for overlapping rules—only the highest percentage applies.
</Callout>

## Viewing Surcharge Calculations

Surcharge calculations are computed when employees clock out. The calculation includes:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Base Minutes** | Total work period duration |
| **Qualifying Minutes** | Minutes where rules applied |
| **Surcharge Minutes** | Additional time credit earned |
| **Total Credited** | Base + Surcharge minutes |

## Best Practices

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Name models and rules clearly so their purpose is obvious. "Sunday Night Shift Premium" is better than "Model 1 Rule A".
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set appropriate priorities">
    When rules might overlap, use priority to control which one wins. Higher priority rules take precedence.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use validity dates for temporary rules">
    For seasonal or temporary surcharges, set validity dates instead of creating and deleting rules.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test before going live">
    Create models as inactive first, verify the configuration, then activate when ready.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document rule logic">
    Use the description field to explain the business rationale for each model.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
