## Usage

### Clocking In

1. Click the z8 extension icon in your toolbar
2. Click the green **Clock In** button
3. A green badge will appear on the extension icon indicating you're clocked in
4. The timer will start showing your current session duration

### Clocking Out

1. Click the z8 extension icon in your toolbar
2. (Optional) Select a project from the dropdown to assign your time
3. Click the red **Clock Out** button
4. The badge will disappear, indicating you're clocked out

### Project Selection

When you're clocked in, you can optionally select a project to assign your time entry to:

1. Click the extension icon while clocked in
2. Use the **Project** dropdown to select a project
3. The selected project will be applied when you clock out

<Callout type="info">
  Project selection is optional. If no project is selected, your time will be recorded as general work time.
</Callout>

### Understanding the Status Badge

The extension icon displays a badge to indicate your current status:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green dot | You are currently clocked in |
| Amber exclamation | Offline actions are queued for sync |
| No badge | You are clocked out |

---

## Offline Support

The extension works even when you're offline or have intermittent connectivity.

### How It Works

1. **Offline actions are queued** - When you clock in or out without internet, the action is saved locally
2. **Automatic sync** - When connectivity is restored, queued actions are automatically sent to the server
3. **Sync notifications** - You'll be notified when offline actions have been successfully synced

### Offline Indicators

- An amber banner appears in the popup when you're offline
- An amber badge (!) appears on the extension icon when actions are queued
- Project selection is disabled while offline (will need to be assigned in the web app)

<Callout type="info" title="Timestamps Preserved">
  When you clock in/out offline, the original timestamp is preserved. Your time entries will reflect the actual time you performed the action, not when it synced.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### Login Required Message

**Problem:** The extension shows "Login Required" even though you're signed in.

**Solutions:**
1. Open your z8 webapp in a new tab and ensure you're signed in
2. Check that cookies are not being blocked for your z8 domain
3. Verify the Webapp URL in extension settings matches your sign-in URL exactly
4. Try signing out and back in to the web app

### Extension Not Connecting

**Problem:** The extension can't connect to your z8 instance.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the Webapp URL in settings is correct (check for typos)
2. Ensure the URL uses `https://` (not `http://` for production)
3. Check if your organization's firewall is blocking the connection
4. Try the **Test** button in settings to verify the URL works

### Badge Not Updating

**Problem:** The status badge doesn't reflect your actual clock status.

**Solutions:**
1. Click the extension icon to refresh the status
2. Check your internet connection
3. Right-click the extension and select "Reload" to restart it

### Notifications Not Working

**Problem:** You're not receiving desktop notifications.

**Solutions:**
1. Check that notifications are enabled in extension settings
2. Verify your browser has permission to show notifications
3. Check your operating system's notification settings
4. Use the **Send test notification** button in settings to verify

### Queued Actions Not Syncing

**Problem:** Offline actions remain queued even when online.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're signed in to the web app
2. Wait for the periodic sync (runs every minute)
3. Click the extension icon to trigger a manual sync check
4. Check the browser console for error messages
