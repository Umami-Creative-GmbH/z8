## Real-Time Updates

The system uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to deliver real-time updates:
- Instant notification delivery
- Live status updates
- No need to refresh the page

---

## Connection Status

The notification system shows your connection status in real-time.

### Status Indicators

Look for the connection indicator near the notification bell:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Green dot** | Connected - receiving live updates |
| **Yellow dot** | Reconnecting - temporarily disconnected |
| **Red dot** | Disconnected - not receiving live updates |

### Automatic Reconnection

When connection is lost, the system automatically:

1. Attempts to reconnect immediately
2. Retries with increasing delays if unsuccessful
3. Shows "Reconnecting..." status
4. Restores live updates when connection is back
5. Fetches any missed notifications

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If you see persistent connection issues:

- **Check your internet connection**
- **Refresh the page** - This reestablishes the SSE connection
- **Check for VPN issues** - Some VPNs block SSE connections
- **Try a different browser** - Rule out browser-specific issues
- **Contact your admin** - There may be server-side issues

### Offline Behavior

When disconnected:
- You can still browse previously loaded content
- New notifications won't appear until reconnection
- Actions may be queued and sync when reconnected
- A banner may appear indicating offline status
