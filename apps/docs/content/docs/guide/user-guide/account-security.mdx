## Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Account

- **Use a unique password**: Don't reuse passwords from other services
- **Update regularly**: Change your password every 90 days
- **Keep it private**: Never share your password with anyone, including IT staff
- **Log out on shared devices**: Always log out when using public or shared computers

### Recognize Phishing Attempts

Be cautious of emails that:
- Ask you to verify your password urgently
- Contain suspicious links or attachments
- Come from addresses that don't match official Z8 domains
- Have spelling errors or unusual formatting

<Callout type="warn">
Z8 will never ask for your password via email. If you receive such a request, report it to your administrator.
</Callout>

### Session Security

- Sessions automatically expire after a period of inactivity
- You can log out of all devices from your profile settings
- The system tracks login locations for security monitoring

## Account Locked?

If your account becomes locked due to too many failed login attempts:

1. Wait 15 minutes for the automatic unlock
2. Or contact your organization's administrator
3. They can manually unlock your account from the admin panel

<Callout type="info">
Account lockouts help protect against brute-force attacks on your account.
