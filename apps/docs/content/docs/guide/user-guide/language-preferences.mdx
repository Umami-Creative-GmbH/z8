## Browser Language Detection

On your first visit, Z8 attempts to detect your preferred language from your browser settings. If your browser language matches one of our supported languages, the interface will display in that language automatically.

To override automatic detection:
1. Use the language switcher as described above
2. Your explicit choice will always take precedence over browser detection
