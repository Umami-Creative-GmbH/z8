This guide covers the additional responsibilities and features available to managers in Z8.

## Manager Overview

As a manager, you have additional responsibilities beyond those of a regular employee:

- **Approve requests** - Handle time-off and correction requests from your team
- **Monitor team schedules** - Ensure adequate coverage
- **View team analytics** - Track team performance and work patterns
- **Calendar overview** - See team absences at a glance
- **Support your team** - Answer questions and provide guidance

## Your Team

### Viewing Your Direct Reports

To see employees who report to you:

1. Go to **Approvals** in the main navigation
2. Your pending requests are from your direct reports
3. Go to **Settings** → **Teams** to see team membership

### Primary vs Secondary Manager

You may be assigned as:

- **Primary Manager** - The main point of contact for an employee
- **Secondary Manager** - Additional approval authority

Both roles can approve requests, but the primary manager is the default contact for the employee.

## Handling Approvals

### Absence Requests

When an employee requests time off:

1. Go to **Approvals** → **Absence Requests**
2. Review the request details:
   - Dates requested
   - Type of absence
   - Employee's reason
   - Current vacation balance
3. **Approve** or **Deny** the request
4. If denying, provide a clear reason

### Time Corrections

When an employee requests a time entry correction:

1. Go to **Approvals** → **Time Corrections**
2. Review what was originally entered vs. the correction
3. Verify the correction is accurate
4. **Approve** or **Deny** as appropriate

### Best Practices

- **Respond promptly** - Employees plan around approvals
- **Be consistent** - Apply the same standards fairly
- **Check coverage** - Ensure team can handle absences
- **Communicate** - Discuss complex situations directly

## Team Coverage

Before approving time-off requests, consider:

- Are other team members already off during that period?
- Are there important deadlines or meetings?
- Is there backup for critical responsibilities?

## Team Calendar

### Viewing Team Absences

The calendar provides a visual overview of your team's availability:

1. Go to **Calendar** from the main navigation
2. Switch to **Team View** using the toggle
3. See all team member absences color-coded by type
4. Click any absence to see details

### Planning Around Absences

Use the team calendar to:
- Identify periods of low coverage
- Plan meetings when everyone is available
- Coordinate vacation schedules across the team

## Team Analytics

### Accessing Team Reports

As a manager, you have access to team analytics:

1. Go to **Analytics** from the main navigation
2. Select your team from the filter
3. View reports including:
   - Work hours by team member
   - Overtime trends
   - Vacation usage
   - Attendance patterns

### Exporting Data

Export team reports in various formats:
- **CSV** - For spreadsheet analysis
- **Excel** - With formatting preserved
- **PDF** - For printing and sharing

## Notifications

### Manager Notifications

You'll receive notifications for:
- New absence requests from your team
- Time correction requests
- Upcoming team member absences
- Birthday reminders for your team

### Configuring Notifications

Customize which notifications you receive:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Notifications**
