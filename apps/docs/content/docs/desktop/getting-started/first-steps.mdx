## Understanding the Timer Display

While clocked in, the button shows your elapsed time:

```
        ┌───────────┐
        │           │
        │  02:34:15 │
        │           │
        └───────────┘
```

| Format | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `00:05:23` | 5 minutes, 23 seconds |
| `01:30:00` | 1 hour, 30 minutes |
| `08:00:00` | 8 hours exactly |

The timer updates in real-time every second.

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you clock in:

1. **API call** sent to your Z8 server
2. **Time entry created** with current timestamp
3. **Tray icon updated** to green
4. **Timer starts** counting in the UI

When you clock out:

1. **API call** closes your time entry
2. **Duration calculated** and saved
3. **Tray icon updated** to gray
4. **Entry synced** to your profile

---

## If You're Offline

Don't worry if your internet connection drops:

1. **Clock in/out still works** - Actions are queued locally
2. **Look for the offline indicator** - WiFi icon with slash appears
3. **Automatic sync** - When back online, entries sync automatically
4. **No data loss** - Everything is stored in a local database

## Next Steps

Now that you've clocked in and out, explore more features:

- **[Idle Detection](/docs/desktop/features/idle-detection)** - How the app detects breaks automatically
- **[System Tray](/docs/desktop/features/system-tray)** - Quick actions from the tray menu
- **[Settings](/docs/desktop/features/settings)** - Customize the app behavior
- **[Offline Mode](/docs/desktop/features/offline-mode)** - Work without internet

## Tips for Daily Use

- **Keep the app running** - It stays in the system tray with minimal resources
- **Use auto-start** - Enable in settings so you never forget to launch it
- **Trust the idle detection** - It will catch breaks you forget to log
- **Check the tray icon** - Green = working, gray = not clocked in
