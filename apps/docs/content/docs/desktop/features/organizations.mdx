import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

If you belong to multiple organizations in z8, you can easily switch between them without signing out.

## Organization Selector

The organization selector appears in the app header when you have access to multiple organizations.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🏢 Acme Corp          ▼     ⚙️     │
│                                     │
│             ...                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Organization icon** | Logo or default building icon |
| **Organization name** | Currently active organization |
| **Dropdown arrow** | Click to see all organizations |

<Callout type="info" title="Single Organization">
  If you only belong to one organization, the selector shows your organization name without a dropdown.
</Callout>

---

## Switching Organizations

1. **Click the organization name** in the header
2. **View the dropdown** with all your organizations
3. **Select an organization** to switch to it

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Switch Organization                │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🏢 Acme Corp              ✓ Admin  │
│  🏢 Beta Industries          Member │
│  🏢 Gamma Consulting         Admin  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each organization shows:
- **Icon/Logo** - Organization's logo or default icon
- **Name** - Organization name
- **Checkmark** - Indicates currently active organization
- **Role** - Your role (Admin, Manager, Member)

---

## What Happens When You Switch

When you switch organizations:

1. **Session updates** - Your active organization changes on the server
2. **Clock status refreshes** - Shows your status in the new organization
3. **Time tracking context** - New entries go to the selected organization

<Callout type="warn" title="Clock Status">
  Your clock-in status is per organization. If you're clocked in at Acme Corp and switch to Beta Industries, you'll see your status at Beta Industries (which may be clocked out).
</Callout>

---

## Organization Roles

Your role determines what you can do in each organization:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control, can delete organization |
| **Admin** | Manage settings, employees, teams |
| **Manager** | Approve time entries, manage team |
| **Member** | Standard employee access |

Your role is displayed next to each organization in the dropdown.

## Syncing Across Devices

Organization selection syncs with the web app:

- **Switch on desktop** → Web app reflects the change
- **Switch on web** → Desktop app updates on next API call
- **Stored in session** → Persists across app restarts

---

## Employee Records

<Callout type="info" title="Employee Record Required">
  To track time in an organization, you need an employee record. If you're a member but don't have an employee record, contact your organization admin.
</Callout>

The app checks for employee records when:
- Fetching your organizations
- Switching organizations
- Attempting to clock in/out

---

## Troubleshooting

### Organization not appearing

1. **Check membership** - Verify you're a member in the web app
2. **Refresh the app** - Close and reopen to refetch organizations
3. **Check connection** - Ensure you're online

### Can't switch organizations

1. **Wait for current operation** - Switching is disabled during loading
2. **Check network** - Switch requires API call
3. **Try again** - Temporary server issues may resolve

### Clock status wrong after switch

1. **Wait for refresh** - Status refreshes after switch
2. **Manual refresh** - Close and reopen the app
3. **Check web app** - Verify your status there
