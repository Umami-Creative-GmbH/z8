Time tracking is the core feature of the z8 Timer. One click to start, one click to stop.

## The Clock Button

The large circular button in the center of the app handles all time tracking:

## Clock Out with Break

When idle detection triggers, you can record a break period:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Idle detected**

    After 5 minutes of no activity, then resuming activity, an idle dialog appears
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Choose "I was on break"**

    This records the idle period as a break
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Automatic handling**

    - Clocks you out at the moment you went idle
    - Immediately clocks you back in
    - Break period is recorded accurately
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Elapsed Time Display

While clocked in, the button shows a live timer:

| Display | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `00:00:15` | 15 seconds |
| `00:05:00` | 5 minutes |
| `01:30:45` | 1 hour, 30 minutes, 45 seconds |
| `08:00:00` | 8 hours exactly |

The timer:
- Updates every second
- Uses monospace font for stability
- Calculates from your clock-in time, not a running counter

<Callout type="info" title="Accurate Time">
  The elapsed time is calculated from your actual clock-in timestamp, ensuring accuracy even if you close and reopen the app.
</Callout>

---

## Status Indicator

The footer shows your current status:

| Status | Indicator | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Not clocked in | ○ Gray dot | Ready to start working |
| Clocked in | ● Green dot | Currently tracking time |
| Syncing | ◐ Animated | Communicating with server |
| Offline | ◐ Yellow dot | Queued for sync |

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

For power users:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T` | Toggle clock in/out |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D` | Open z8 dashboard in browser |

<Callout type="info">
  Keyboard shortcuts work globally when the app is running, even if the window is closed.
</Callout>

---

## API Integration

Time entries are synced to your z8 server:

### Clock In

```
POST /api/time-entries
{
  "action": "clock_in",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T09:00:00Z"
}
```

### Clock Out

```
POST /api/time-entries
{
  "action": "clock_out",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T17:30:00Z"
}
```

### Offline Handling

If the API is unreachable:

1. Action is queued locally (SQLite)
2. UI updates optimistically
3. Background processor retries every 30 seconds
4. Syncs automatically when connection restored

## Best Practices

- **Clock in when you start** - Don't wait until after your first task
- **Clock out for long breaks** - Lunch, appointments, etc.
- **Trust idle detection** - It catches breaks you forget
- **Check the tray icon** - Quick visual status check
- **Keep the app running** - Minimize to tray, don't quit
