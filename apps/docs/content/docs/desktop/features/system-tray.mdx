import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The z8 Timer lives in your system tray for always-available access without cluttering your desktop.

## Tray Icon Location

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| **Windows** | System tray (bottom-right, near clock) |
| **macOS** | Menu bar (top-right) |
| **Linux** | System tray (varies by desktop environment) |

---

## Icon States

The tray icon changes color to indicate your clock status:

| Icon | State | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| Gray clock | Not clocked in | Ready to start tracking |
| Green clock | Clocked in | Currently tracking time |

This gives you instant visibility of your work status without opening the app.

Right-click (Windows/Linux) or click (macOS) the tray icon to see the context menu:

```

│ Settings            │
│ ──────────────────  │
│ Quit                │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Menu Actions

| **Settings** | Opens settings dialog directly |
| **Quit** | Completely closes the app |

## Minimizing to Tray

The app is designed to live in the tray:

1. **Close button** - Minimizes to tray (doesn't quit)
2. **Minimize button** - Minimizes to tray
3. **Tray click** - Brings window back

<Callout type="info" title="Always Running">
  Even when the window is closed, the app continues running in the tray. Idle detection and offline sync continue working.
</Callout>

### Quitting the App

To actually close the app:

1. Right-click the tray icon
2. Select **Quit**

Or use keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Cmd + Q` (when window is focused)

---

## Always-on-Top

The app window can stay above other windows:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Enable **Always on Top**
3. The window will stay visible above other applications

**Useful for:**
- Quick clock in/out while working
- Seeing elapsed time while you work
- Keeping the app accessible

You can still minimize to tray even with always-on-top enabled.

---

## Hidden Icon (Windows)

If you can't see the tray icon on Windows:

1. Click the **^** arrow in the system tray
2. Look for z8 Timer in the overflow area
3. Drag it to the main tray area for quick access

### Pin to Taskbar

1. Right-click the overflow arrow (^)
2. Select **Taskbar settings**
3. Under "System tray icons", find z8 Timer
4. Enable **On**

---

## Tray Icon Not Showing

### Windows
- Check the overflow area (^ arrow)
- Restart Windows Explorer: `taskkill /f /im explorer.exe && start explorer`

### macOS
- Check System Preferences → Dock & Menu Bar
- Ensure menu bar extras are allowed

### Linux
Common issues:

| Desktop | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **GNOME** | Install TopIcons Plus or AppIndicator extension |
| **KDE** | Should work natively |
| **XFCE** | Ensure systray plugin is added to panel |
| **i3/Sway** | Use waybar or polybar with tray support |

---

## Resource Usage

The tray component is lightweight:

| Metric | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| Memory | ~5 MB |
| CPU | 0% when idle |
| GPU | None |

The icon only redraws when status changes (clock in/out).

---

## Customization

Currently, the tray icon style is not customizable. It uses:

- Gray clock icon for "not clocked in"
- Green clock icon for "clocked in"

Future versions may support custom icons or themes.
