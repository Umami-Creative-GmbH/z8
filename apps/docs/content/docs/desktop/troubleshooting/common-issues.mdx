## Sync Issues

### Time entries not syncing

**Symptoms:**
- Offline indicator stays on
- Entries don't appear in web app
- Pending queue count doesn't decrease

**Solutions:**

1. **Check internet connection**
   - Open a website in your browser
   - Try pinging the server

2. **Verify server is reachable**
   ```bash
   curl https://time.yourcompany.com/api/health
   ```

3. **Check queue status**
   - Open the app
   - Look for pending count indicator

4. **Restart sync**
   - Close and reopen the app
   - Queue processor restarts automatically

### Duplicate entries

**Symptoms:**
- Same time entry appears twice in web app
- Overlapping clock in/out times

**Solutions:**

1. **Delete duplicates in web app**
   - Log in to z8 web app
   - Go to your timesheet
   - Delete the duplicate entry

2. **Check offline queue**
   - If entries are queued multiple times
   - Clear queue by signing out (loses pending data)

  The server prevents true duplicates, but network issues can sometimes cause race conditions.

## Clock Issues

### Clock button not responding

**Symptoms:**
- Clicking clock button does nothing
- Button shows loading spinner indefinitely

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait a moment** - API call may be slow
2. **Check network** - Offline mode should queue the action
3. **Restart app** - Force quit and reopen
4. **Check logs** - Look for error messages

### Wrong elapsed time

**Symptoms:**
- Timer shows incorrect time
- Time doesn't match server

**Solutions:**

1. **Refresh status**
   - Close and reopen the app
   - Status is re-fetched from server

2. **Check system clock**
   - Ensure your computer's time is correct
   - Enable automatic time sync

3. **Timezone mismatch**
   - Check your system timezone
   - Verify z8 organization timezone setting

### Can't clock out

**Symptoms:**
- Clock out fails repeatedly
- Button stays red/active

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if already clocked out**
   - Verify in web app
   - Server may have already recorded clock out

2. **Try offline mode**
   - If online sync fails
   - Action will be queued

3. **Manual entry in web app**
   - As last resort
   - Create manual time entry with correct times

## Idle Detection Issues

### Idle detection not triggering

**Symptoms:**

3. **Check app is running**
   - Verify tray icon is visible

4. **Check permissions (macOS)**
   - System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility
   - Enable z8 Timer

5. **Check permissions (Linux)**
   - Add user to `input` group
   - Log out and back in

### Too many idle prompts

**Symptoms:**
- Idle dialog appears too frequently
