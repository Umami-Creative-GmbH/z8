## Vacation Policies

### Organization Default Policy

To set the organization-wide vacation policy:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Vacation** → **"Policy"**
2. Configure default settings:
   - **Default Annual Days**: Base vacation days per year (e.g., 20)
   - **Carryover Policy**: Allow/disallow carryover
   - **Max Carryover Days**: If allowed, maximum days that can carry over
   - **Accrual Method**: Front-loaded, accrual, or custom
3. Click **"Save Policy"**

**This policy applies to all employees by default** unless overridden individually.

### Employee-Specific Allowances

To customize vacation allowance for an individual employee:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Vacation** → **"Employees"**
2. Find the employee
3. Click **"Edit"** next to their name
4. Configure custom allowance:
   - **Custom Annual Days**: Override org default (leave blank to use default)
   - **Carryover Days**: Days brought forward from previous year
   - **Adjustment Days**: Add or subtract days (can be positive or negative)
   - **Adjustment Reason**: Required explanation for adjustments
5. **Review total allowance** displayed at top
6. Click **"Save Changes"**

### Allowance Calculations

Total allowance is calculated as:
```
Total = Annual Days + Carryover + Adjustments
```

**Example:**
- Annual Days: 20 (org default)
- Carryover: 5 (from last year)
- Adjustments: +2 (bonus days)
- **Total Available: 27 days**

1. Create employee profile
2. Set appropriate annual days (may be prorated)
3. Note: Some organizations prorate first-year vacation

**Long-Service Bonus:**

2. Add adjustment days (e.g., +5)
3. Enter reason: "10-year service bonus"
4. Save changes

**Correction (Employee Miscounting):**
1. Review actual usage
2. Add/subtract correction via adjustments
3. Document reason clearly
4. Communicate with employee

### Vacation Assignment System

For flexible policy allocation, use the vacation assignment system:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Vacation** → **"Assignments"**
2. Create assignment rules:
   - By tenure (e.g., +2 days after 5 years)
   - By position level
   - By team or department
3. Assignments automatically calculate based on employee attributes
