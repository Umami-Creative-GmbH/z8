## Understanding Multiple Managers

The system supports assigning multiple managers to each employee with these features:
- **Primary Manager**: One manager designated as the main point of contact
- **Secondary Managers**: Additional managers with equal approval authority
- **Approval Rights**: Any assigned manager can approve requests
- **Notifications**: All managers receive notifications about their managed employees
