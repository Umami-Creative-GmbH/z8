## 🛡️ GoBD & Legal Compliance

Z8 is engineered from the ground up to be audit-ready and legally compliant.

- **Immutable Ledger**: Time entries are cryptographically linked in a blockchain-style chain. Existing records cannot be deleted or stealthily modified.
- **Traceable Corrections**: Any changes to time records require a replacement entry with a full audit trail and manager approval.
- **Digital Integrity**: Automated background checks verify the integrity of the data chain to protect against database manipulation.
- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive event logging for all administrative actions, from user permission changes to organization settings.

## ⏱️ Advanced Time Tracking

- **Multi-Platform Access**: Clock in via the full-featured **Web Dashboard**, the **Mobile App** (iOS/Android), or the low-profile **Tauri Desktop widget**.
- **Correction Workflows**: Streamlined process for employees to request time corrections, with instantaneous manager notifications.
- **Quick Actions**: Global "Time Clock" popover in the web header for friction-less clock-in/out even when navigating other modules.
- **Live Status**: Real-time visibility into who is currently clocked in within your team.

## 🏖️ Absence & Holiday Management

- **Holiday Presets**: Automated import of country-specific and regional public holidays (Deutschland, Bundesländer support).
- **Vacation Balance Tracking**: Sophisticated calculation of remaining leave days based on flexible assignment policies.
- **Flexible Categories**: Pre-configured status types including Home Office, Sick Leave, Vacation, and custom absence types.
- **Approval Engine**: Visual timeline for managers to review and approve absence requests while checking for team coverage conflicts.

## 📊 Insights & Reporting

- **Advanced Analytics**: Interactive dashboards for team performance, location trends, and workforce distribution.
- **Export Ready**: Generate reports for payroll or regulatory audits with advanced filtering capabilities.
- **Organization Management**: Manage multi-location setups, team structures, and distinct department hierarchies.

## 🔔 Modern Experience

- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Stay informed via In-app alerts, Desktop Push notifications (Web Push), and Email templates.
