1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this
   list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
   this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
   and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

3. Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its
   contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
   this software without specific prior written permission.

4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, and as a material
   condition of the rights granted herein, licensees are strictly prohibited
   from altering, removing, obscuring, or replacing any "Z8" branding,
   including but not limited to the name, logo, or any visual, textual, or
   symbolic identifiers that distinguish the software and its interfaces, in
   any deployment or distribution. This restriction applies to all deployments
   regardless of the number of users. Branding removal or modification is
   available exclusively to enterprise license holders upon explicit written
   request and approval by the copyright holder; such permission is granted
   at the sole discretion of the copyright holder and is not guaranteed as
   part of any enterprise license agreement.

5. Competing SaaS Prohibition.
   (a) You are strictly prohibited from offering the software (or any
      substantial portion of it) to third parties as a hosted or managed
      service in a manner that competes with Umami Creative GmbH's Z8 hosted
      offering (a "Competing SaaS Offering"), unless you have a duly executed
      enterprise license from the copyright holder that expressly permits
      such use.
   (b) A "Competing SaaS Offering" includes, without limitation, making the
      software available as (i) a generally available hosted service for
      multiple unaffiliated organizations, or (ii) a hosted service that is
      marketed, positioned, or used as a substitute for Umami Creative GmbH's
      Z8 SaaS offering.
   (c) For avoidance of doubt, self-hosting and use of the software by an
      organization for its own internal workforce (including commercial
      organizations) is permitted, subject to the Fair Usage Policy and the
      end-user threshold below.
   (d) Internal self-hosted use is permitted without an enterprise license
      only where the total number of end users (defined as individual natural
      persons with direct access to the application; i.e., employees/users)
      does not exceed twenty-five (25) within any rolling thirty (30) day
      period. Organizations exceeding this threshold require a duly executed
      enterprise license.

6. Billing Feature Restriction.
   (a) "Billing Features" means any code, configuration, UI, API routes,
      workflows, or integrations included with the software that enable or
      facilitate paid subscriptions, plan gating, metering, invoicing,
      payment processing, or similar monetization functionality, including
      but not limited to any Stripe integration.
   (b) Billing Features are restricted to use by Umami Creative GmbH. You are
      strictly prohibited from enabling, operating, or using Billing Features
      in any deployment or distribution, except where expressly permitted by
      a duly executed enterprise license from the copyright holder.
   (c) You may remove or disable Billing Features in your deployments and
      distributions, provided you otherwise comply with this License.

7. All code, modifications, or derivative works incorporated into this project
   prior to the incorporation of these clauses remain licensed under the BSD
   3-Clause License, and prior contributors retain all BSD-3 rights therein;
   if any such contributor requests the removal of their BSD-3-licensed code,
   the copyright holder will do so, and any replacement code will be licensed
   under the project's primary license then in effect. By contributing after
   this clause's adoption, you agree to the project's Contributor License
   Agreement (CLA) and to these updated terms for all new contributions.
