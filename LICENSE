4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, and as a material
   condition of the rights granted herein, licensees are strictly prohibited
   from altering, removing, obscuring, or replacing any "Z8" branding,
   including but not limited to the name, logo, or any visual, textual, or

   any deployment or distribution. This restriction applies to all deployments
   regardless of the number of users. Branding removal or modification is

   exceeds twenty-five (25) within any rolling thirty (30) day period require a duly
   executed enterprise license from the copyright holder. Use of this software
   by organizations exceeding this threshold without an enterprise license
   constitutes a material breach of this license.

   the copyright holder will do so, and any replacement code will be licensed
   under the project's primary license then in effect. By contributing after
   this clause's adoption, you agree to the project's Contributor License
   Agreement (CLA) and to these updated terms for all new contributions.
